Pin (http://www.pintool.org/) is a tool for dynamic instrumentation of programs. There are pin tools available (included with the Pin distribution) that can instrument every memory reference from an executing application.

The problem however is the fact that Pin instruments these
instructions before the virtual-to-physical memory translation happens in the hardware ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit ). Hence, the memory reference address reported by Pin is the virtual address of the memory access.

Linux however provides a hook into the OS' page table (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table ) using pagemap (
http://lwn.net/Articles/230975/ ). Pagemap allows looking at the page table to determine physical pages mapped to virtual pages and there are tools to look at the pagemap from the Linux kernel ( http://selenic.com/repo/pagemap/ ).

The basic aim of this project then is to determine the virtual to physical mapping of addresses generated by memory references trapped through Pin. A typical work-flow would involve querying a tool/script every time an unknown virtual address page is encountered during the execution of an application under pin. The tool/script would return the physical frame mapped to the virtual frame in question.
